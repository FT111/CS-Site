                <h2>Patrick Hanratty is known as the "Father of CAD", having wrote the first numerical control program in 1957.</h2>
        
                <p>His program, PRONTO (Program for Numerical Tooling Operations), allowed 2D user input via a computer to control an 
                    industrial CNC machine. This assisted the manufacture of increasingly advanced designs. 
                    <br><br>
                    Analysts have estimated
                that 70% of all 3D mechanical CAD/CAM software today trace their roots back to Hanratty's program.</p>

                <p>Highly complex for its time, it used a screen and buttons for users to adjust parameters. It is considered an
                    early prototype of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).<br><br> Unfortunately, it was never
                    commercially available. However, Sutherland went on to create a pioneering computer graphics company with David Evans.

                <p>However, it remained niche due to the enterprise, expensive nature of CAD at the time. 3D software 'CATIA' was released by French Aerospace manufacturer Dassault in 1977, 
                    used to design the Mirage fighter jet. <br><br> CAD systems by IBM, United Computing, Applicon and Intergraph were also released at the time.

                    <h2>UNIX computers marked the beginning of the large scale adoption of CAD.</h2>
            
                    <p>The IBM PC assisted the spread of CAD into automotive, aerospace and shipbuilding industries. One of the most popular CAD software was released in 1982, AutoCAD, 
                        by AutoDesk for the IBM PC. This increased its affordability for smaller businesses and depth of its functions.
                        <br><br>
                        Pro/ENGINEER was released in 1987, introducing parametric (rule based) modelling which is now a core tenet of modern CAD software.

                        <h2>The 1990s marked the shift from UNIX to Windows PCs</h2>
                
                        <p>PC's were capable of far greater performance than slower UNIX workstations. The shift began when the first Windows CAD software was released, SolidWorks.
                            Its success led to its swift acquisition by Dassault Systémes in 1997 for $320 million (approximately $609 million today).<br><br>

                            The remainder of the 90s was the consolidation of smaller CAD software into larger software, via acquisitions. Innovation slowed down as all major software
                            reached similar features.

                        <h2>In the 21st Century, CAD is widespread and accessible to even personal users</h2>
                
                        <p>Modern CAD software is often internet-connected, allowing for seamless collaboration. A number are also cloud-based, meaning they process instructions via remote
                            hardware, rather than on the local system. This allows for the use of CAD modelling on far weaker hardware.<br><br>

                            The variety of user inputs has expanded. Users can now interact with a touchscreen, mouse or digital pen. Recently, there have also been expansions into 
                            virtual reality, aiding visualisation of models. <br><br>

                            LibreCAD released in 2011, a Free and Open Source (FOSS) CAD program. Developed to be similar to AutoCAD, it provides a free alternative to expensive
                            commercial software.
